# blockip
This is a tool to prevent other computers from going to certain sites.
The code here was partially copied from WifiKill. I only modified it. 
I don't really know why I made this. I had a good reason, but I forgot.
Anyway, this first scans the network for other devices. You can attack one device. You can then enter fragments of an IP or URL to block.
The reason I added this is because some sites have multiple IP addresses. One such example is Amazon Web Services. There are a few apps that use this, such as Clash of Clans or IFunny. Most Amazon Web Service apps connect to 54.x.x.x, or 52.x.x.x.
This script is probably illegal to use on networks you're not allowed to use it on.

Requirements: Python 2.7 and Scapy
